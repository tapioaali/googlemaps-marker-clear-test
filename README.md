# Google Maps Marker Clearing Test Application #

An app created to test `GoogleMap#clearMarkers()` which worked unexpectedly at some point. See it running at [tapio.app.fi](http://tapio.app.fi/googlemaps-clearmarkers-test/).

This project serves also as a simple example Eclipse project for the add-on. Please notice that it contains all JARs required by Google Maps (including `gwt-ajaxloader` and `gwt-maps-api`) in `WEB-INF/lib` instead of using Ivy to manage them. 

For full add-on check out its [GitHub page](https://github.com/tjkaal/GoogleMapsVaadin7). 

The add-on is also available at [Vaadin Directory](https://vaadin.com/directory#!addon/googlemaps-add-on).
